# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  # Tailwind  & Props
  - In this section I learn about tailwind css. How used it properties padding. Margin, text, font etc
  - And learn about  props. Props is a properties of element.
  ## Props -:
  -  are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are a fundamental concept used to make components more reusable and dynamic. Props allow components to be dynamic by giving them the flexibility to receive and use data that is passed from other components.
